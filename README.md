# Light-A-Video
This repository is the official implementation of Light-A-Video. It is a **training-free framework** that enables 
zero-shot illumination control of any given video sequences or foreground sequences.

> Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, 
have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. 
However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets.
A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: 
lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos.
In this work, we propose \textbf{Light-A-Video}, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting.
Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency.
First, we design a Consistent Light Attention \textbf{(CLA)} module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers 
to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, 
we apply linear blending between the source videoâ€™s appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion \textbf{(PLF)} strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. 
Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video
while maintaining the image quality,  ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.
